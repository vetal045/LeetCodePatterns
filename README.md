#LeetCode Preparation Repository
This repository is dedicated to my preparation for technical interviews using LeetCode. It serves as a central hub for storing my solutions to LeetCode problems, studying various problem-solving patterns, and documenting my progress. By organizing my preparation materials in this repository, I aim to enhance my understanding of data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques commonly encountered in technical interviews.

#Repository Structure
patterns/: This directory contains implementations of different problem-solving patterns such as Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Binary Search, and more. Each pattern has its own folder with solutions to problems that can be solved using that pattern. The README.md file in this directory provides an overview of each pattern and its application.

#problems/: This directory is organized based on different problem types such as Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, and more. Within each problem type folder, problems are further categorized by difficulty level or specific topics. This structure allows me to practice solving problems from various domains and track my progress. The README.md file in this directory provides an overview of the different problem types and their characteristics.

#Progress Tracking
To track my progress, I will update the README files in the patterns/ and problems/ directories with links to the solved problems. Additionally, I will include brief explanations, time and space complexity analysis, and any important insights gained during the problem-solving process. By regularly committing my solutions and progress updates, I can easily review my work and monitor my improvement over time.

#Contribution
While this repository primarily serves as a personal learning resource, I welcome contributions, suggestions, and discussions related to LeetCode problems, patterns, or any other aspect of technical interview preparation. If you have any valuable insights or alternative solutions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Together, we can create a collaborative environment that promotes knowledge sharing and growth.
